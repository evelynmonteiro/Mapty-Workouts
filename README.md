## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I Learned

The main objective of project development in learning is to fix the content about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

So I learned how to create classes and generate inheritance in ES6 and also some principles like the encapsulation of attributes and functions.
